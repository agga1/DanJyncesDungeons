in every world folder (e.g. world_1) there should be at least one file with name: "room_{pos_x}_{pos_y}.txt" which
contains specification of the room (with position [{pos_x}, {pos_y}]) written in that way:

first line: two integers which represents size of the room: first is the number of elements from left ot right, second is the number of elements from top to bottom
second line: there are strings which represent positions of doors separated by 1 space ("top", "bottom", "left", "right")
third line: i - number of enemies in the room
next i lines: 3 (4th is optional) variables connected with the enemy: first one is the type of enemy, next 2 variables
represent a position in the room where that enemy starts, 4th one represents the direction of movement in the beginning
(just for enemies which are not following main character) "up", "down", "left", "right"

types of enemies:
- bat: it follows main character

example:
12 12
classic
2
bat 450 450
bat 100 200

it is a classic room with size [12, 12] which contains 2 bats at the positions: [450, 450] and [100, 200]

you can write comments if there is at least one space after last necessary for room building variable in the line
(except for line with type of room - in this line do not add anything)
