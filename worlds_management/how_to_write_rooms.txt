in every world folder (e.g. world_1) there should be at least one file with name: "room_{pos_x}_{pos_y}.txt" which
contains specification of the room (with position [{pos_x}, {pos_y}]) written in that way:

first line: two integers which represents size of the room: first is the number of elements from left ot right, second is the number of elements from top to bottom
second line: it is one string which represent type of the room (now there is just classic)
third line: i - number of enemies in the room
next i lines: 3 variables connected with the enemy: first one is the type of enemy, next 2 variables represent a position in the room where that enemy starts

types of rooms:
- classic: there are walls which surround the room

types of enemies:
- bat: it follows main character

example:
12 12
classic
2
bat 450 450
bat 100 200

it is a classic room with size [12, 12] which contains 2 bats at the positions: [450, 450] and [100, 200]

you can write comments if there is at least one space after last necessary for room building variable in the line
